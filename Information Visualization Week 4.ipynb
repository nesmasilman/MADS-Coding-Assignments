    "I created the emoji bars visualization using Altair. I used the emojis as scatter plot marks to represent the top 10 emojis' % of being used. Talking about expressiveness, I believe both the original vis. and my vis. have the same level of expressiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the effectiveness, I think my visualization might be better because having the emoji shapes in different positions relative to each other (higher/lower) would be easier in comparison and for being more memorable, unlike the original chart in which the emoji shape is put outside the chart, so people need to look at the emoji first and then move their eyes towards the bar length to know the value, this might be less effective. For example, the \"tears of joy\" emoji will be  memorable for readers because it is located in the highest point. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also added text above the emoji to clarify the exact % to the reader, and i left the x-labels as ranks to make it easy for readers to spot the exact rank for any emoji.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing i believe is negative about my visualization is that the y-axis values should be in % format since the text values used are in %.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of design principles, we can maximize the data-ink ratio by eliminating any un-needed elements, like writing the values of ranks on x-Axis (the positions of emojis on x-axis already says this information), and also removing the text with the % since this could be known by looking at the y-axis values. However, I believe doing this will make the chart less effective, because if i wanted to know the rank of any emoji without having the ranks written I would have to count till i reach it, and also knowing the % might be hard with the absence of horizontal gridlines, especially if the emojis % are very close like the last 4 ones."

    "Considering Tufti's principle of \"Chart Junk\", if we are evaluating this visualization in terms of the rule (thou shalt not use chart junk), then we would find that this rule is not applied here. Because the chart uses extra ink to add data that might be un-needed, such as the 2 photos of Ali in the bottom left and in the middle of the pie chart, and also the picture of the double gloves beside his name and in the center of the pie (we could have used only 1 glove per color inside the pie to write the totals). However, in my opinion I believe that adding these pictures was useful because it catches the eyes of readers and would make them remember the chart content easily. Additionally, the picture in the bottom left of Ali beating a player would really give an impression of how legendary he was (My only concern on this photo is that it might be biased against this player in the photo in case he can be identified, and also it might be offensive for the players who were defeated by Ali).\n",

    "It is also noticed that the chart creator used 2 shades of green & red colors. The light shade to make it easy to write the match competitor name, and the darker one is easier to distinguish different matches and for being more visible for people having problem with light colors. Although this point might also be considered extra un-needed junk because we could have used only 1 shade but i also find that using the 2 shades makes the chart more attractive and memorable."

    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT DATA ISSUE*: There are some differences in the data that 538 used and what we have. This will cause some issues to how things are normalized. Things should look very similar, but you may find, for example, that the scale of tweets when you normalize is different than the original figure. This is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "*IMPORTANT STYLING/ANNOTATION* NOTE: Part of this assignment is to get styling and annotation to be as close to 538 as possible. Altair and Vega-Lite aren't super helpful for annotation purposes. You will find that you need to do things like layering text and the arrows (hint: see [here](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/issues/1721)). What I usually do in practice (when I need the visualization to look good and have annotation) is get things as close to how I want them to look, export the image as an SVG and then load it into [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/), or [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). You can see \"reasonably close approximations\" in the examples we provide. Those have been generated using nothing but Altair."

    "For the nearly 15,000 people in Las Vegas’s T-Mobile Arena on Saturday night, and the millions more huddled around TVs across the world, the Floyd Mayweather–Conor McGregor fight was a roller coaster of emotions. They were anxious as pay-per-view [technical problems](http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/20469815/floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-delay-ppv-problems) pushed back the fight’s start. They were full of anticipation when the combatants finally emerged after months of hype. They were surprised when McGregor held his own, or seemed to hold his own, for a couple of rounds. They were thrilled when Mayweather finally started fighting. And they were exhausted by the end.\n",

Five seconds later, Mayweather leapt up on the corner ropes, victorious — [50-0](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/mayweather-is-defined-by-the-zero-next-to-his-name/). Some observers declared it a [satisfying spectacle](https://www.si.com/boxing/2017/08/27/after-months-hype-mayweather-and-mcgregor-deliver-boxing-spectacle). Others, McGregor chief among them, [were frustrated with the finish](https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/conor-mcgregor-frustrated-with-refs-fight-stoppage-let-the-man-put-me-down/). The emoji users on Twitter appeared to think the fight was, for the most part, 🔥 — especially as it heated up toward the end. While the result may never have been in question, this was a welcome outcome for many who viewed Mayweather’s last megafight against Manny Pacquiao as an epic 😴😴😴😴."

The original visualization displays the same data, however, spotting the trend in a specific minute is very hard due to using 15 minutes intervals in X-Axis which can make it hard to spot an exact minute.\n",
